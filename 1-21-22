In 'Reward Is All You Need' we are told reward can account for nearly all the behaviors referenced in the embodiment hypothesis. Given that this may be the case,
doesn't the confirmation of this paper's claims take priority over nearly all other possible experiments. Is the simple confirmation of an identifiable signal at
the last layer during a feed forward pass through such a network sufficient? Is more required?
