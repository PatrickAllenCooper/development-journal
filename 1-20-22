Recently, I have stumbled across some remarkable work conducted by Lawrence W. Barsalou, specifically on the topic of nothingness being something humans are able to
capture thanks to our explicit experiences.

I wonder what Chomsky would have to say about something derived on this level.

I am reminded of the presence of negative space within film, and, in particular, in painting.

This would be an interesting topic to investigate.

What form does nothingness take in latent space across a host of models?

A difficult prompt to fulfill since surely the encodings will all be different.
